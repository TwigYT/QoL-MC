## Are there any resource packs or shaders in this modpack?

</div>

Yes! This pack contants [Fresh Animations](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations) and [xali's Enhanced Vanilla](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/xalis-enhanced-vanilla) to show off some of the extra features [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) gives you. This pack also contants [Complementary Shaders - Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) to add some shaders if you what.

## But I can't play with my friends because I don't want to pay for a server

</div>

This is also a issue this pack correct with the [World Host](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host) mod. This mod makes the open to LAN system able to open to anyone else running the world host mod using a [safe system](https://github.com/Gaming32/world-host?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-this-mod-work).
